# Analysing-NYC-tree-data
The repo contains a CSV file of the dataset of New York City trees and a jupyter notebook containing analysis of the dataset.
The analysis focuses on various aspects of the available data like the width of the trees trunks, the health of the trees, whether they are dead, alive or just stumps. It looks at which boroughs have most of certain types and which neighborhoods certain trees are located.
